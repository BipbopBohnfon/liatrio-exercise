## Introduction

This project is made as part of the evaluation for the Liatrio Internship. It is a basic web server that sends anyone connecting a Json object containing my name and a Unix timestamp. There's not much to see here but take a look if you'd like. There's also some github actions action going on here.

## Usage

TODO: Figure out what needs to be written cause... there's not much that a user would even interact with... nothing to use.
